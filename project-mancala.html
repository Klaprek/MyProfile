                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>Mancala is a traditional board game played by two players, with the primary objective of collecting as many seeds (or stones) as possible into each player's storage pit, known as the "mancala." The game is played on a board with 12 small pits (6 per player) and 2 large pits (mancalas) at both ends. This Java-based implementation supports two game modes: Player vs Player (P1 vs P2) and Player vs Computer (P1 vs COM).</p>
                        <h2>Features</h2>
                        <p><span class="tebal">P1 vs P2: </span>Two human players can compete in a turn-based Mancala match, selecting pits from their side to distribute seeds according to the game's rules, with the winner determined by who collects the most seeds in their mancala.</p>
                        <p><span class="tebal">P1 vs COM: </span>A single player can challenge a computer opponent that uses a basic strategy to select moves, providing a practice mode for players without a human opponent.</p>
